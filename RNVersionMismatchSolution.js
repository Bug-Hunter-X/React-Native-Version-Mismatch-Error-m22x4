The solution depends on the library and React Native version. Here are a few common fixes:

1. Update the library to a version that is compatible with your React Native version. Check the library's documentation for compatibility information.

2. Downgrade React Native to a version that is compatible with the library. This is generally not recommended, as it may break other parts of your application. 

3. If possible, use a different library that is compatible with your React Native version.

4. If none of these steps work, you may need to report the issue to the library maintainers.
